## Why typescript

In short: preference. I like types, yes they are some kind of overhead, but they add the benefit of the transpiler able
to check whether I mada a typing error or not. I don't need to let the code run and notice this hours later, I see this
right away in the IDE. I'm grown up as a java developer, so it is second nature for me to think in types.
